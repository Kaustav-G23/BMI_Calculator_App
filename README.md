# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Our Goal

The objective of this Project is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 


## What we will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. 

## What we will learn

- How to use Flutter themes to create coherent branding. 
- How to create multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- How to extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button. 
- How to pass functions as parameters and fields.
- How to use the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- How to use custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- How to customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
- Understand Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Learn about composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
- Understand the difference between const and final in Dart and when to use each.

## Difficulties faced

- In handling multiple screens.
- Customizing the Flutter Widgets and achieving the specific design.


## Conclusion

- Had great fun in building the app. Learned a lot of new things while designing the UI. Learned about new methods, technologies, widgets and implemented them successfully.
